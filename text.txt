Create a simple social media application using Node.js, Express and MongoDB that allows users to create an account, login, create posts, view posts, and follow other users. You can use Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database, and handle user authentication and authorization using a library such as Passport. bcryptjs can be used for password encryption
